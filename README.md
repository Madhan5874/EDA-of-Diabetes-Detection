The exploratory data analysis (EDA) for the Diabetes Detection project involved a comprehensive examination of the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset to uncover patterns, anomalies, and relationships among the features. Key steps included visualizing the distribution of each feature, identifying missing values, and examining correlations between variables. Insights were gained by plotting histograms, box plots, and scatter plots, revealing significant differences in attributes like glucose levels, insulin levels, and BMI between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. The EDA highlighted critical features influencing diabetes, guiding feature selection and engineering for model development. This thorough analysis ensured a solid foundation for building accurate and robust predictive models.
